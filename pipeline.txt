topic: bodybuilding

features:
1. asnwer use question about bodybuilding
2. Allow users to log exercise stats and session into

2. Tries to determine which action this user is trying to perform

Pipeline

Input ->
	[Question Or CallToAction Model]
	- if Question -> [Question Classification Model] -> {Call External LLM}
		- issue: how to determine which questions are within scope (meaning still workout related)
	- if CallToAction -> [CallToAction Classification Model] -> {Call service API}
